# Angular Graphs

This project uses data generated from my python script at
[yt-channel-stats-comparison](https://github.com/priyank99/yt-channel-stats-comparison) and plots them as live graphs which update when data is added to the CSV file containing the statistics.

### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
